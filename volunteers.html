      <h2>Volunteers</h2>
				<p>We have over 30 Volunteere her at the center and all play an active role in the running of the center. 
		Some of our volunteers have been offering their services since the very early days, over 40 years ago.
		We really value contribution they make to the center and we couldn't do it withouth them.
		Their duties include serving lunches each day , fundraising, maintenance work , entertainment and organising annual events such as our Christmas Craft Fair.</p>
